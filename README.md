# Analysis - David W. Mueller

    I compared each US state and the District of Columbia (DC) by the number of data scientist employment positions per 1,000 people 25 years of age and older with at least one bachelor’s degree. I also compared annual median wage for data scientist occupation for each US state and DC. Annual median wage included the 10th and 90th percentiles for each US state and DC. Data on employment were missing for five states: Delaware, New Mexico, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. Data on annual median wage were missing for four states, including Delaware, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming, however, data for New Mexico was included.
    Data on employment were collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics May 2020 estimates for data scientists and all other mathematical science occupations. Data on educational attainment, degree type, and academic field were collected from the US Census 2019 American Community Survey, 1 year estimate.
    According to the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification System, a data scientist is defined as someone hired to develop and implement methods to transform raw data into meaningful information using data-oriented programming languages and visualization software. This includes the application of data mining, data modeling, natural language processing, and machine learning to extract, analyze, and present data from large structured and unstructured datasets (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020).
    I found that the five states with the highest employment of data scientists per 1,000 people 25 years of age and older with at least one bachelor’s degree included Illinois, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, and Tennessee. All five states had over 1,000 total data scientist employment and from five to nearly ten positions per 1,000 people 25 and over with a bachelor’s degree in any field. Illinois had the highest employment per 1,000 people 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree, with 9.8 employment per person, and 3,290 total employment. Tennessee had the least employment and employment per 1,000 people 25 and older with a degree among the top five states. Employment was 1,280, with five per 1,000 people 25 and older with a degree. 
    The annual median wage for data scientists in Illinois was $96,500. The 10th percentile was $56,100 and the 90th percentile was $154,010. Tennessee had a lower annual median wage, at $78,750. The 10th percentile was $52,550. The 90th percentile was $135,860. The state with the highest annual median wage was California, equalling $127,310. It also had the greatest 90th percentile wage, at $197,890. California also had the largest number of raw employment, at 9,510. There was only one employment per 1,000 people 25 years and older with a bachelor’s degree. The five states with the highest annual median wage were California, New York, Washington, New Jersey, and Arizona. Of these, all were above $100,000. Arizona was the lowest with $111,900 annual median wage. Surprisingly, Arkansas’s annual 10th percentile wage was $80,310, the highestes in the US.

# About Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)

Estimates are made from three years of survey data, covering 1.1 million establishments and about 57 percent of the employment in the United States. Estimates are established for every May and November. This improves the reliability of estimates for detailed occupations in small geographical areas. Combining multiple years of data is necessary to obtain full coverage of the largest establishments. In order to reduce respondent burden, the OEWS survey samples these establishments with virtual certainty once every three years. Limitations associated with this estimation procedure are that it requires "updating" for the earlier years of data and limits the usefulness of OEWS data for time series analysis (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021).

## 2018 Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC) Definitions

    Data Scientists:
        Develop and implement a set of techniques or analytics applications to transform raw data into meaningful information using data-oriented programming languages and visualization software. Apply data mining, data modeling, natural language processing, and machine learning to extract and analyze information from large structured and unstructured datasets. Visualize, interpret, and report data findings. May create dynamic data reports. Excludes "Statisticians" (15-2041), "Cartographers and Photogrammetrists" (17-1021), and "Health Information Technologists and Medical Registrars" (29-9021).

## Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) Definitions

    Employment:
        The estimated total occupational employment (not including self-employed).

    Employment per 1000 jobs: 
        The number of jobs (employment) in the given occupation per 1,000 jobs in the given area.

    Location Quotient (State, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan statistical area estimates only):
        The ratio of an occupation's share of employment in a given area to that occupation's share of employment in the U.S. as a whole. For example, an occupation that makes up 10 percent of employment in a specific metropolitan area compared with 2 percent of U.S. employment would have a location quotient of 5 for the area in question.

    Median Wage:
        The estimated 50th percentile of the distribution of wages based on data collected from employers in all industries; 50 percent of workers in an occupation earn less than the median wage, and 50 percent earn more than the median wage (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021).
