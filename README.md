# About Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)

Estimates are made from three years of survey data, covering 1.1 million establishments and about 57 percent of the employment in the United States. Estimates are established for every May and November. This improves the reliability of estimates for detailed occupations in small geographical areas. Combining multiple years of data is necessary to obtain full coverage of the largest establishments. In order to reduce respondent burden, the OEWS survey samples these establishments with virtual certainty once every three years. Limitations associated with this estimation procedure are that it requires "updating" for the earlier years of data and limits the usefulness of OEWS data for time series analysis (OEWS, 2021).

    Data Scientists:
        Develop and implement a set of techniques or analytics applications to transform raw data into meaningful information using data-oriented programming languages and visualization software. Apply data mining, data modeling, natural language processing, and machine learning to extract and analyze information from large structured and unstructured datasets. Visualize, interpret, and report data findings. May create dynamic data reports. Excludes "Statisticians" (15-2041), "Cartographers and Photogrammetrists" (17-1021), and "Health Information Technologists and Medical Registrars" (29-9021).

    Employment:
        The estimated total occupational employment (not including self-employed).

    Employment per 1000 jobs: 
        The number of jobs (employment) in the given occupation per 1,000 jobs in the given area.

    Location Quotient (State, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan statistical area estimates only):
        The ratio of an occupation's share of employment in a given area to that occupation's share of employment in the U.S. as a whole. For example, an occupation that makes up 10 percent of employment in a specific metropolitan area compared with 2 percent of U.S. employment would have a location quotient of 5 for the area in question.

    Median Wage:
        The estimated 50th percentile of the distribution of wages based on data collected from employers in all industries; 50 percent of workers in an occupation earn less than the median wage, and 50 percent earn more than the median wage.
